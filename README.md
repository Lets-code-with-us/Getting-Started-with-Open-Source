## 1. Concept of Open Source ü§ù
Imagine you have a cool project, like a super fun game. Right now, only you can play it because you have the secret rules (code). Now, what if you tell your friends the rules, and they start adding cool new things to your game? That's like Open Source! üéÆ

Open Source means sharing the rules (code) of your project with everyone. Just like when you share your game rules, others can see, learn, and even add new features. For example, imagine if Google shared how they make Google Maps. People can help make it better by fixing problems and adding cool stuff. üó∫Ô∏è

It's like a big team helping each other for free! And if you help, too, it's like getting a special badge that says, "I helped make this cool thing!".

Imagine if you could tell everyone, "I helped make Google Maps!" That's why Open Source is damn awesome.

> You don't have to be a tech expert. Open Source is for everyone, even those who don't know how to code. Yes, even for YOU :)

I hope you get a little idea of what Open Source is.

![Open source isn't about perfect code; it's about passion and the noble goal of making lives better.

### Roadmap to Open Source

There is no one-size-fits-all roadmap in open source. Each individual has their unique journey and approach to getting involved. When I started, I stumbled into open source while exploring GitHub, unaware of its vast potential. So, if you're new, embrace the journey and enjoy the exploration!

## 2. Why Should You Contribute to Open Source?

> Open Source is more than merging a PR.

In today's interconnected world, participating in an open-source community offers numerous benefits and opportunities for personal growth.

You **Code**. **Collaborate**. **Network**.

You don't need a job, experience, or technical expertise to get started. The open-source community is incredibly inclusive and supportive.

What will you learn?
- Practical knowledge and modern development practices.
- Credibility and the chance to connect with like-minded individuals.

Most importantly,
You will always be welcome.
And YOU interact with experienced people all the time. üî•

## 3. What It Means to Contribute

For newcomers, the prospect of contributing to open source can be daunting.

You may wonder:
- How do I find the right project?
- What if I lack coding skills?
- What if something goes wrong?

&nbsp;

### You don‚Äôt have to contribute code

I've said it enough times, saying it again.
A common and deadly misconception about contributing to open source is that you must contribute code.
Trust me, you don't have to.

- If you like planning events.

   - organize workshops or meetups for the project.
   - Help community members find the correct medium for speakers

- If you like designing.

   - Improve the design to increase usability.
   - You can make a style guide that developers can follow for a consistent visual design.
   - You know about UX laws that you use to propose changes.
   - Create a new logo and improve branding.

- If you like writing.

   - Improve documentation and contributing guidelines
   - Write tutorials and suggest newsletters.
   
   > Don't underestimate the power of documentation.

- Do you like coding?

   - Solve technical problems.
   - Suggest new features.
   - Improve testing and other code standards.

Now, you need to find a good software project, right?

Hell, nah!

- You can work on [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

- You can contribute and frame [interview questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)

And a whole lot more! Explore it yourself.

## 4. What are the roles in a typical Open Source project?

This is important, and everyone needs to be familiar with the roles.

### Contributors:

These people contribute to the project in one way or another. They follow `contributing guidelines` which guide them on how they can contribute and help the project grow.

&nbsp;

### Maintainers:

Every good open source project has a lot going on, and these people are responsible for driving the vision and goals of a project. They review the code and suggest and consider features.

They are more like an internal part of the team.

The tasks can differ based on the team.
Some maintainers assign people to issues, while some help in reviewing the code, and do several other works.

I'm also an open source maintainer of LinksHub.

&nbsp;

### Author:

The person/s or organization who created the project has the power to recruit maintainers, assign new roles, and is the main authority.

&nbsp;

### Project Owners:

The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or project (not always the same as the original author)

&nbsp;

### Community members/Users:

These are the members of the community who can provide feedback about the product, suggest bugs or improvements, and many more.

These are neither contributors nor maintainers, just the users of the product.

---

## 5. Pre-requisites (Git + GitHub + Markdown).

The open source community is on GitHub, and so you need to know a bit about Git & GitHub.

Let's cover each.

&nbsp;

### Git

Git is a version control system. It helps you keep track of your code's changes and manage code across teams.

You should know how to:
- Create a repository
- Add files to a repository
- Commit changes
- Create branches
- Merge branches

### GitHub

GitHub is a platform built on top of Git. It's where people share and collaborate on code. It‚Äôs like social media for coders.

You should know how to:
- Fork a repository
- Clone a repository
- Create pull requests (PRs)
- Review pull requests
- Merge pull requests

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It‚Äôs what you use to style your writing on GitHub.

You should know how to:
- Format text
- Create headers
- Make lists
- Add links
- Insert images

## 6. Conventional Commits üìù

Conventional commits provide a standardized format for commit messages, enhancing clarity and communication within projects. They follow a simple structure of `<type>(optional scope): <description>`.

For example:
- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: resolve issue with login`

Using conventional commits helps maintain a clean and structured commit history, making it easier to understand changes and track issues.
